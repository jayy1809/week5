Acknowledgements Presentation inspiration and motivation has always played a key role in the success of any venture. We would like to thank Dr. Payal Chaudhari(faculty advisor of the club) and the entire team members and special thanks to Jay Gohil for sharing some valuable insights to the participants. And thanks to the participants for making this event a success. Introduction of the Club Encode, the computer science club of Pandit Deendayal Petroleum University is focused to make people feel the beauty of programming. The goals this year are not only to make students aware of different programming languages and coding but also with the necessity and its application in the real world. The club’s main objective is to support programming as an initiative to empower logical skills as well as object-oriented skills. 2 | Page --- Event Details Event Description Encode has conducted a workshop on Artificial Intelligence And Machine Learning. It was conducted by Jay Gohil. The objective of the event is to help students to gain some insights on the latest subjects of study in Computer Science. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning have become the centerpiece of strategic decision making for organizations. They are disrupting the way industries and roles function - from sales and marketing to finance and HR, companies are betting big on AI and ML to give them a competitive edge. Topics covered during the 2-day workshop were given below: ➢ Introduction and Applications ➢ Types of Machine Learning ➢ Minor ML Project using Python ➢ Processes of ML ➢ Performance Metrics ➢ Different Algorithms of ML This introduction-level hands-on course explores the field of artificial intelligence (AI), programming, logic, search, machine learning (ML), understanding. You’ll learn current AI and ML methods, tools, techniques, and their application to computational problems. In this workshop, we’ll cut through the math and you’ll learn exactly how machine learning algorithms work. We’ll focus on the algorithms used to create machine learning models. Using clear explanations, simple Python code (no libraries), and step-by-step labs, you’ll discover how to load and prepare data, evaluate your models, and implement a suite of linear and nonlinear algorithms along with assembling algorithms from scratch. You’ll also learn about algorithm applicability along with their limitations and practical use cases. This workshop presents a wide variety of related technologies, concepts, and skills in a fast-paced, hands-on format. This provides you with a solid 3 | Page --- foundation for understanding and getting a jumpstart into working with artificial intelligence and machine learning. Participants who were not having any prior programming experience have been taught everything from the ground level and they have gained very much knowledge through the workshop. Event Registration Details There were 209 registrations for this event. All the registrations were from PDPU students. There was no registration fee.
